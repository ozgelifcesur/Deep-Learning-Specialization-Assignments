This repository contains my assignment in 4 courses in Deep Learning Specilization by Andrew Ng.
Each Assignment has detailed explanation at the beginning of the Jupyter notebook.
Here is a list of Topics I learned and applied through these courses:

Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
Logistic Regression, Gradient descent, Deep Neural Networks, Forwardprop and Backprop

Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization:
Random initialization, Dropout, L2 regularization, Normalization, Gradient checking for Vanishing and exploding gradients
Mini-batch gradient descent, RMSprop, Adam optimization algorithm

Convolutional Neural Networks:
Convolution layers, Pooling layers, ResNets, YOLO algorithm for object recognition, Intoduction to Face Recognition

Sequence Models:
RNNs, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNNs, Word2Vec, GloVe, Negative Sampling, Beam Search, Introduction to Attention Models

Used Python libraries: Tensorflow, Keras
